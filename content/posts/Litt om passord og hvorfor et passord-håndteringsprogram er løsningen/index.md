“200+ years ago among
the Scandinavian Pirate Islands…”

PIRATES vs
TYRANTS

It is a period of piratical war.
Scandinavian Pirate Rebel ships, striking
from a hidden base, have won
their first victory against
the Tyrannical British
Imperial Navy.

During the battle,Scandinavian Pirate Rebel
spies snuk unboard to steal the secret
technical drawings of the
Tyrannical British
Imperial Navy's
ultimate weapon, the monstrously
huge DICTATOR,
a ship with a twin set of experimentally
enormous cannons with long enough range to
bombard and burn down the
island towns of the Scandinavian Pirate Rebels.

Pursued by the British Empire's
sinister agents, the Scandinavian
Pirate Princess Frøydis races
for home aboard her
sleek little ship, custodian of the
stolen drawings that can save
her Scandinavian pirate people
from tyranny and restore
freedom to the Scandinavia Pirate Islands…

among the same Scandinavian Islands, but back
in our present time Lilly (11) is sooo
boooored in the summer cabin with her mother, preparing for for a summer party
of boring grown ups toghether with her
grandmother and a gigantic gray cat.

Lilly (11) wants freedom to work on her
own programming project,
with a real client.
Real freedom to make my own decisons on the project. Lilly knows her mother will say "no
you need to earn you spurs as a software
developer first."


Once the crawl ends, we pan past a couple of islands to reveal a cacophonous sea battle erupts around us and a small pirate ship glides past pursued by a much larger ship-of-the-line that seems to go on forever.

The pirate ship glides past a bunch of other pirate ships. The Victory crashes up on the shore and broad sides them for 45 minutes, until they are sunk.

Only Frøydis's ship is left afloat among the wreckage and floating dead and swimming pirates

BatCat and boy on board the pirate ship, they are helpless bystanders to a musket battle between the Rebel pirates and the Imperial boarding party.

as a chaotic musket battle rages on deck of the pirate ship, BatCat and Boy pass between a spider web of criss-crossing musket balls and are miraculously unharmed.

Once the pirates are dead, the leader of the Imperial Forces makes his entrance, a towering red-clad figure,

a feminine hand programming the parrot,

Jump'n wave

Lilly sees the splash and the waving in her old brass spyglass.

She sees the little boat floating along un-stopped.

She sees the heads of the parrot and Boy come up breathing hard.

Se runs down to the boat.
–I will save the parrot and boy!

–You cannot let nobody know we are here. We have some bade Guys looking for us...
–Really?! Fascinating! I promise.
They go up the 89 steps to the cabin and Lilly hides parrot&boy in the wood shed.
–Surely you must be joking this is going to be darn cold when the sun goes down.
–I might be able to smuggle you insde when everybody is asleep, but I might also not, they usually stays up late. Here is a towel I'll dry you off bird. You don't mind if i call you bird do you?
–Not in the least. Ah, yeah scratch my head...The parrot croacked.
–You like that?! Hm bird?

–Help me Obi-Bos WesObi you are our only hope. (In a womans rich voice.)
–Who is she?
–That's nobody, I mean...Sorry about that...The parrot croacked.
–No don't be sorry. She’s sounds cool...
–It’s a private message for Obi-Bos WesObi, not for you girl. (In the croaky parrot voice.)

Back inside around the table for the evening meal.
–Hey mom, who is Obi-Bos WesObi? Maybe it is Ben WesObi?
–“That wizard is just a crazy old man.” A dude named Ben. No good. Her mother answers

–OOkaaay... Anyway I want to go to that code boot camp in New York City after the summer.
–No I need your help on our new Gatsby.js plugin this season.

–Ok, then next season I want a real code project with a real client. Real freedom to make my own decisons on the project. And I want real money that refelcts the value I bring to the client.
–I'll think about if you have enough experience for handling a client on your own, but adventure is what you crave, admit it!

Lilly, realizing she will get neither the truth about WesObi nor freedom to pursue her goals, leaves the table in frustration. She climbes Skull Hill and watches the sun set in the sea from the Tooth, clearly feeling trapped by duty and lack of understanding. Listening to the waves chrush on the beach. She pulls out her old brass telescope. Is that a sail on the horizon?

Lilly goes into wood shed.
–What's up boy? You look down.
–The bird left.
–What!? Where did it go?
–To this Obi-Bos WesObi, never heard of her.
–I know where he lives. Wait Ben WesObi is a she?
–That's what the birds says.
–It is too dangerous to go into the Thorn Park Forest after dark. We need to pass the Singing Lagoon as well. It is a bad enough area during the day. The area is bad enough during the day.
–We're going anway, aren't we? The boy grinned.
–Yes we are. I bring a flashlight, but we won't use it, it will attract attention from the wrong creatures.

Sneaking into the dark Thorn Park Forest they catch up with the parrot by the lagoon.

–Yesss, scratch my head!
–What a good bird.

(7.2 = q)
–What a good boy... for dinner!
–Roooarh!

They are ambushed and attacked by the Sea People. The attackers are scared off by the fiercesome sound of an approaching creature. This sound is merely a fog horn and the creature turns out to be Old Ben

Ben pulls back her hood, revealing her kindly young girls face for the first time, and says
–Hello Captain Morgan my little friend.
–You have great hair!
–Thanks, let's get to my house, the sea people scary eaily, but they will soon be back in greater numbers.



(7.4)
–Did you build this house yourself?
–Yeah! How did you guess? He he, I love building things, and as you see I don't have that much experience.

Captain  SilverStockings turns to Lilly and says with a twinkle in his eye, “You must re-learn the basic ways of Java Script if you’re to come with me to Gatsby Town.”

–I'm not going to Gatsby Town with you, because ...
–“You must do what you think is right, of course.”

On the Dictator +200 years ago
talking about the stolen plans, the power of the Rebel Alliance, and whether or not they pose a threat.

The commander of the Imperial Fleet believes that the Empire is vulnerable, but the commander of the Dictator believes otherwise.

Vader promises to deliver the stolen plans soon, in addition to the location of the secret Rebel Base, and
Horatia Nelson lays out the plan of crushing the Rebellion once and for all by using the Dictator to destroy the island upon which the city of Gatsby Haven town is located.
