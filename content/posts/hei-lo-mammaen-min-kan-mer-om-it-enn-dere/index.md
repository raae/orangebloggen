Their ship is caught ... and pulled close to the Dictator!
Lilly says, “I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”
Dvorak: “They won’t take me without a fight,” and UnicornParrot gives out a worried bellow,
A-da: “There are alternatives to fighting,”

As we near the Dictator, we get a sense of its enormous size for the first time.
